<p>HomeWay is a global online food application, where people can order handmade unique items such as cakes, pastries, and chocolates for their family and friends.
HomeWay was founded in 2013 by sisters Mary and Susan, who were looking for a way to connect with their loved ones through the food they make. The idea for HomeWay came about when the two were discussing how difficult it is to find time to bake and cook for loved ones living in different parts of the world.
That's when we decided to create an online platform that would allow people to order homemade food from anywhere in the world. HomeWay has since become a leading provider of online food ordering services, connecting people with home cooks and bakers in over 100 countries.</p>
